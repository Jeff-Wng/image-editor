# image-editor
Image editor that looks for a URL and allows edits using the provided CSS filters

  A very simple app that allows the user to enter a URL. The URL must be https, as GitHub pages doesn't allow mixed content. When the picture
is loaded, it can be editied using the sliders on the side. These sliders correspond to all the provided CSS filter options. This app was created
in early 2018, so any new fitlers that may of been added is not included beyond that time frame.
